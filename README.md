# Computer Science Fundamentals II - Assignment 3

## Description
The snake game is played on a rectangular grid on a rectangular board. There are 4 classes of objects placed on the squares of the grid: rocks, apples, scissors, and a snake. The snake moves around the board trying to eat as many apples as it can, but avoiding the rocks, exiting the board, or overlapping with itself. Whenever the snake eats an apple, it grows and whenever it touches a pair of scissors it shrinks. The user controls the movement of the snake and the goal is to eat as many apples as possible. The game ends when the head of the snake touches a rock, it tries to move outside the board, or it touches any part of its body.

To run the program, open PlayChasingGame.java and enter a board layout text file (board1.txt, board2.txt, board3.txt). The arrow keys control the direction of the snake. Additionally, these keys control other settings:
- f: increases the speed of the snake
- s: reduces the speed of the snake
- p: pauses the game
- x: terminates the game
